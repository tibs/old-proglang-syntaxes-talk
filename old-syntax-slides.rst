(What may now seem) syntax oddities in older programming languages
------------------------------------------------------------------

Some notes intended to accompany a talk on (what may now seem strange) syntax
in older programming languages.

...but it's OK to read them by themselves.

Introduction
------------

Only looking at "old" programming languages (remember, Python is from the
early 1990s, so old means "quite old"), because they may be
unfamiliar. Although, strangely, mostly still in use, in one form or another.

Also, only looking at things we'd call a "high level" programming language, so
ignoring things like Autocode (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocode) which
is closer to an assembly language.

Ignoring lots of things I think you might already know - so nothing much on
functional languages (ML, Haskell, etc.).

Weighted heavily towards programming languages I know a little bit about, of
course.

Timeline?
---------

Maybe just for the notes..

==============  =========
FORTRAN         1954
FLOW-MATIC      1955-1959
LISP and Algol  1958
COBOL           1959
==============  =========

----

Plankalk√ºl
----------

?do I want to mention this?

Designed by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945. It was the first high-level
programming language to be designed for a computer. First implemented in 1975

FORTRAN IV - an example
-----------------------

This is not valid FORTRAN...

.. code:: fortran

          PRINT 2000
          GOTO 1100
    1000  END
    1100  PRINT 2100
          GOTO 1000
    2000  6HHello
    2100  6HWorld!

----

FORTRAN IV - bottles
--------------------

.. code:: fortran

        INTEGER BOTTLS
        DO 50 I = 1, 99
        BOTTLS = 100 - I
        PRINT 10, BOTTLS
        PRINT 20, BOTTLS
        PRINT 30
        BOTTLS = BOTTLS - 1
        PRINT 10, BOTTLS
        PRINT 40
  50    CONTINUE
        STOP
  10    FORMAT(1X, I2, 31H bottle(s) of beer on the wall.)
  20    FORMAT(1X, I2, 19H bottle(s) of beer.)
  30    FORMAT(34H Take one down and pass it around,)
  40    FORMAT(1X)
        END

FORTRAN IV - Leading spaces
---------------------------

The first 6 columns and their uses

----

FORTRAN DATA CARDS
------------------

* Comment Cards

  The first character on the card much be C; all other characters are ignored
  in subsequent processing.
   
* Statement Cards
  
  Statement cards are subdivided into four sections as follows:

::

                  1         2         3         4         5         6         7            8
    12345 | 6 | 789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012 | 34567890

       
* The first five characters are used for unique statement numbers. Numbers do
  not need to appear in sequence.  Any statement (except the END statement)
  may have a statement number.

* The sixth character is called the "continuation" character.  If more space
  is required from the previous card, include any character (except space
  or 0) in the 6th position of the next card.

  One convention was to put a 0 in the continuation field of the first card
  (the one start was to be continued).

* Positions 7-72 are used for the actual program code.  Often programmers use
  a TAB (8 spaces) rather than type 7 spaces.

* Positions 73-80 are infrequently used, but when they are they are used for
  identification codes which are only of interest to the programmer, they are
  not computed.


(actually, putting a sequence number in that last column is pretty important
in case you drop the deck of cards!)

----

FORTRAN IV
----------

No reserved words, context gives meaning.

Spaces within program code are ignored.

So:

.. code:: fortran

            IF(IF.EQ.PROGRAM)IF=IF*PROGRAM

is legal FORTRAN (of some type)

Also, case is not relevant - although I had a habit of typing all the code in
CAPITALS (after all, that's what your left little finger is for).

I remember that the Fortran compiler we used was limited to 6 character
variable, function and subroutine names, which made writing libraries
interesting...
            
----

FORTRAN IV - Computed GOTO
--------------------------


Arithmetic IF:
    
        IF (numeric-expression) statement1,statement2,statement3
   
Evaluate the expression, then transfer to statement1 if the result is
negative, to statement2 if zero, to statement3 if positive.  For example,

.. code:: fortran
          
        IF (X/Y*Z) 100,300,50
        
If the result of the computation is negative, transfer to statement number
100, if zero transfer to statement number 300, if positive to statement
number 50.

(if/then/else invented by Lisp?)

----

FORTRAN - Functions versus subroutines
--------------------------------------

Are those the right terms?

function returns a single value (assigned to the function name)

subroutine returns 0 or more values, by modifying the variables in its
parameter list

----

LISP - as we know it
--------------------

...

----

LISP as it was meant to be
--------------------------

The *original* syntax, that never seemed quote worth it

----

My father's parentheses
-----------------------

Franz Lisp (?) and the ``]``

...the inevitable xkcd cartoon

----

COBOL
----

Do I have anything to say?

----

Snobol
------

Double check

``<expression>, <jump if T>, <jump if F>``

----

BCPL
----

Also:

* ``$( .. )$``
* ``IF .. THEN`` and ``TEST .. THEN .. ELSE``

----

Distraction - character sets
----------------------------

* 6 bit, 7, bit, 8 bit, 9 bit characters
* ICL 6 bit - how to represent lower case characters
* ASCII
* EBCDIC
* ISO 646
* ISO 10646 and Unicode (let's not go into details)

and others...

----

ASCII versus EBCDIC
-------------------

Characters that are in one but not the other

* https://www.daytodaygk.com/ascii-vs-ebcdic/
* http://www.dynamoo.com/technical/ascii-ebcdic.htm (opinitionated!)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC/

----

APL - ancestor of R
-------------------

Give an example of APL versus R

----

Algol 68 - case stropping
-------------------------

Why this was needed.

Other ways of doing it (Algol 68 keywords in CAPS, ??? keywords in single
quotes)

(also, bold stropping in print)

----

Algol 68 - whitespace in variable names
---------------------------------------

.. code:: pascal

   Strictly speaking we do not need this temporary variable but
   the code is clearer if we have it = 3

----

Algol 68 - REFs
---------------

Explain

----

RPG
---

Compare to Snobol

Can I actually make a sensible example for this?

----

JCL - Job Control Language
--------------------------

IBM

Again with the significant placement of things in columns

----

Smalltalk
---------

Almost no syntax

----

Occam
-----

Signficant indentation!

----

Erlang and Prolog
-----------------

Full stop to end expressions/statements, not semicolon

(I've heard people say Erlang is inspired by Prolog in some sense?)

----

Forth and stack based languages
-------------------------------

(maybe mention PostScript and thus also PDF)

----

Maybe TCL?
----------

Not sure

----

We do not talk about INTERCAL
-----------------------------

Not *really* a language people use

----

...

----

Interesting links

Probably more for the notes than for the slides. Not necessarily entirely
pertinent to this exact topic...
